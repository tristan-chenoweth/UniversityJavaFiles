		I started off by importing the scanner for future use in my code. I then stated the basic code including the
		class information. I then defined my variables to use. I then required input from the user on the alloted
		salary. I then set up equations to take the percentage in decimal form that Alice wanted to put towards that
		specific area. I then had the computer print out each individual budget number on its own line of code.
